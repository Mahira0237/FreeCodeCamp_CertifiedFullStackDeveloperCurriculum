        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for creating web pages. When you visit a website and see content like paragraphs, headings, links, images, and videos; that's HTML. HTML represents the content and structure of a webpage through the use of elements.</p>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a crucial component of modern web development. It's a markup language used to apply styles for HTML.

In simpler terms, if HTML is the structure of a web page, CSS is what makes it look good.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that brings interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.

While HTML and CSS are markup languages used to structure content and style elements on a page, JavaScript goes beyond those by enabling more complex functionality, such as handling user input, animating elements, and even building full web applications.</p>
